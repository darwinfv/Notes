# Notes

A simple notepad, that runs in the browser.  

There are zero lines of server-side code, so everything runs locally. Whatever you type will be visible only to you, in that specific browser. Deleting your browser history (cookies, cache) will result in losing your notes, so don't do that. Bookmark it or add a shortcut for quick access.

Features:   
<li>You can rename the title for each note  
<li>Autosave!
